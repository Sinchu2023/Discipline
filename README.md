## 🌑 SHADOW Engine (Competitive Tracking System) ⭐ NEW

The SHADOW Engine is an innovative competitive system that tracks your performance against your personal best. It creates an internal competition where you battle against your own "SHADOW" - your strongest historical 7-day rolling average.

### ⚔ How SHADOW Works

**The Shadow Concept**: Your SHADOW is calculated from your historical data - it's the best 7-day rolling average you've achieved. Every day, you're competing to match or exceed this benchmark.

- **Shadow Average**: Your strongest historical 7-day average (dynamically updated as you improve)
- **Current Performance**: Your actual productivity today and this week
- **Competitive Metrics**: Real-time comparison showing how close you are to breaking your personal standard

### 📊 SHADOW Metrics Dashboard

#### Current You Card
- **Weekly 7-Day Average**: Your actual average for the past 7 days
- **Momentum**: 📈 Growing, ➡️ Stable, 📉 Declining
- **Gap vs Shadow**: How far ahead (+) or behind (-) you are from your Shadow
- **Weekly Delta**: Weekly gap analysis vs your SHADOW
- **Today's Target**: Minimum minutes needed today to maintain/exceed Shadow
- **Progress Percentage**: Real-time progress toward today's target

#### The SHADOW Card
- **SHADOW Average**: Your strongest historical 7-day average
- **Rank Tier**: Current tier based on minutes tracked
- **Monthly Wins**: Days this month you've met or exceeded your SHADOW
- **Days Since Last Win**: How many days since you last beat your SHADOW
- **Shadow Lead Streak**: How many consecutive days your SHADOW is winning

### 🏆 Status Indicators

Your daily status is determined by how close you are to breaking your SHADOW:

- **🟢 STANDARD BROKEN** (100%+): You've exceeded your SHADOW! Victory!
- **🔵 AT THE GATE** (90-99%): So close! Nearly there!
- **🟡 TRAILING** (70-89%): Making progress but still behind
- **🔴 OUT OF RANGE** (<70%): Significant gap to close

### 🎖️ Ranking Tier System

As you increase your SHADOW average, you unlock new ranks:

| Tier | Minutes | Badge |
|------|---------|-------|
| Initiate | 0+ | Baseline |
| Builder | 120+ | Builder |
| Operator | 180+ | Operator |
| Executor | 240+ | Executor |
| Elite | 300+ | Elite |
